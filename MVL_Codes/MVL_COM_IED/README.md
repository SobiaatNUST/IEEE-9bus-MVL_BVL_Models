This directory contains PRISM/Storm models for the IEEE 9-bus protection system using a Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) approach. 
The model set evaluates how Communication (COM) failure probabilities affect system behavior across selected fault cases.
A parallel setup can be used to study the effect of relay (IED) failure probabilities.
The folder also includes PCTL properties and shell (.sh) / Python (.py) scripts to batch-run all models, extract results, and produce tidy outputs.
